# AudioExtractor
This Python script downloads a YouTube video, extracts the audio, and uses the Demucs model to separate and identify musical instruments. It checks for significant sound in each separated audio file and plays back high-quality audio for the identified instruments, ensuring accurate detection and quality output.
