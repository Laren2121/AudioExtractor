# AudioExtractor

This Python script downloads a YouTube video, extracts the audio, and uses the Demucs model to separate and identify individual musical instruments. It then analyzes each separated audio file to detect significant sound levels. For instruments that are identified with substantial audio, the script plays back high-quality audio, enabling accurate instrument detection and output. This tool is especially useful for practicing guitar riffs in heavy metal music with drums in the background, as it isolates and highlights specific instruments, enhancing the practice experience.
